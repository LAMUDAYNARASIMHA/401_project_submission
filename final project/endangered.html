                <p>Endangered species are animals, plants, or other organisms that are at serious risk of extinction. Extinction means that a species completely disappears from the Earth, and once gone, it cannot be brought back. The issue of endangered species is a critical concern for biodiversity, ecosystems, and the overall health of our planet.</p>
                <p>Habitat Loss: The primary cause of species endangerment is habitat destruction. Deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion are leading causes of habitat loss. When animals lose their natural homes, they struggle to find food, shelter, and breeding grounds, making survival difficult.
                </p>
                <p>Climate Change: Global climate change is altering the environments in which species live. Rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, and increased frequency of extreme events like droughts and floods are making it hard for many species to adapt, leading to declines in their populations.
                </p>
                <p>Pollution: Pollution from industrial activities, agriculture, and waste disposal can poison ecosystems. Water pollution, air pollution, and soil contamination can have severe effects on the health of species, often leading to reduced populations and increased mortality.
                </p>
                <p>Overexploitation: Overhunting, overfishing, and poaching are significant threats to many species. The illegal wildlife trade, driven by demand for animal products like ivory, fur, and exotic pets, has led to sharp declines in the populations of many species.</p>

                    <p>Invasive Species: Non-native species introduced to new environments can become invasive, outcompeting, preying on, or bringing diseases to native species. This can lead to the decline or extinction of native species.</p>
                    
                    <p>Disease: Diseases can spread rapidly in animal populations, especially when species are already stressed by other factors. This can cause sudden and severe population declines, particularly in species with limited geneticÂ diversity.</p>
